General Material :
	1. Photogrammetry Course by Cyrill Stachniss : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyB7Wg1e62A&list=PLgnQpQtFTOGRYjqjdZxTEQPZuFHQa7O7Y&ab_channel=CyrillStachniss
		Opinion : 
			I love his lectures (although they are not perfect), I found them to be a great supplement to the below readings. 

	2. Computer Vision Textbook by E.R. Davies : https://www.amazon.ca/Computer-Vision-Principles-Algorithms-Applications/dp/012809284X/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=computer+vision&qid=1637010868&sr=8-5
		Opinion : 
			As my first computer vision textbook I thought it was pretty good, especially the first half of the book. I really liked how the author provided the pseudo code, this gave me a good idea 
			of how to take the mathematical terms and put them into code. Another great thing is that he gives a summary in point form of what he will cover in said chapter, and the concluding 
			remarks with further readings. Now my problem with this book is that its only great in the first half, I don't mean everything in the second half is bad, but its not up to the same level. 
			One quick example, is fundamental matrix which I enjoyed, and found insightful, and triangulation which I thought was lacking. I thought that the author could have provided more 
			information on the triangulation. 

	3. Computer Vision Textbook by Richard Szeliski : 
		a. To be released 2nd edition : https://www.amazon.ca/Computer-Vision-Applications-Richard-Szeliski/dp/3030343715/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=computer+vision&qid=1637010891&sr=8-15
		b. Draft copy of the 2nd edition : https://szeliski.org/Book/
		Opinion : 
			This is my second textbook that I read (partially) on computer vision. I have read / still reading the august draft of the textbook (Note : he has september draft done which he says is his
			final). The great thing about this book is the detail the author goes in to explain the mathematics behind most/all topics. Just by readings this textbook I would think it would be
			difficult to take this ideas and put them straight into code, hence I think having an additional resource that explains how to take these topics and put them into code would be extremely
			beneficial. This is where I found E.R. Davies textbook to be more helpful with pseudo code.
