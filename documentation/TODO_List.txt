In Progress TODO List :

	# TODO : Implement local bundle adjustment for 2 view SfM.

Prioritized TODO List :

	# TODO : Extend 2 view SfM , to N view SfM.

3D Reconstruction Backlog TODO List :

	# TODO : The reconstructed data looks a bit skewed, needs to be investigated.

	# TODO : Need to validate if the frame, and reconstructed data is going to be useful, if not then discarded.
		# Note : In paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08583 , they use base line angle between the cameras to determine a view selection score.

	# TODO : Consider adding specific object detection + localization (example face, hands, apple) to improve reconstruction 

	# TODO : Consider adding object pose estimation. Example, if face orientation is known, we can re-align the points.
	
	# TODO : Implement global bundle adjustment.
	
	# TODO : Add outlier filtering.

General App Backlog TODO List :

*New

	# TODO : Add a display argument to the calibration command.
	# TODO : Add a display refresh delay argument to the calibration command.
	# TODO : Add logging.
	# TODO : Implement argument validation.
	# TODO : Add basic GUI control.
	# TODO : Add unit tests. (There is a lot of it to do, so better start soon.)
		1. Commands.
		2. Arguments.

	# TODO : Allow the user to save generated data from the reconstruction.
	# TODO : Create a requirements.txt file.

*Improvements	
	
	# TODO : Improve the reconstruction 3D plot.
	# TODO : Create a abstract config, and let utility apps inherit it.
	# TODO : Split Zhang's method implementation into a separate class, to inherit from a virtual calibration class.
	# TODO : Wrap calibration_arguments.py into a class.
	# TODO : Move input_stream to common code.
	# TODO : Create an abstract class for the argument, and create an argument class for each option. Example, CalibrationPathArg inheriting from ArgumentInterface. A lot of arguments can be re-used (Example paths, image names, etc...). Note : This has been partially done, but needs to be expended.
	# TODO : Simplify display arguments ON/OFF enums are not required, it just added complexity, switch to simple boolean common argument.
	# TODO : Replace dict switches with new switch cases from python 3.10.
